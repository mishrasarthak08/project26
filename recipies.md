Place Nestlé MILKMAID, milk, water, egg and 1 tbsp butter, and Vanilla essence in a bowl, beat well.
Sieve maida, baking powder and salt and fold into the Milkmaid mixture. Blend well till no lumps remain. Do not over mix. Keep aside for 10 minutes.
Heat heavy bottom nonstick pan, smear with little melted butter. Pour a ladle full of batter and spread lightly to get a ¼ inch thick pancake.
When bubbles come on top, flip over and cook the other side. Remove from pan and place it on a plate. Repeat with the rest of the batter and stack the pancakes on the plate.
Topping: Beat Nestlé MILKMAID and cream. Add seasonal fruits.
Serve it along with Pancake or pour over each serving.
NOTE: Other toppings like Maple Syrup. Honey, Chocolate syrup, cream, and fresh fruits can be served with pancakes.
